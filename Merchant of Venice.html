THE MERCHANT OF VENICE
</font></center></h1>
<br><center><font face="arial"size="4">
Bassanio, a young Venetian of noble rank, wishes to woo the beautiful and wealthy heiress Portia of Belmont. Having squandered his estate, Bassanio approaches 
his friend Antonio, a wealthy merchant of Venice and a kind and generous person.  Antonio agrees, but since he is cash-poor - his ships and merchandise are busy at 
sea - he promises to cover a bond if Bassanio can find a lender, so Bassanio turns to the Jewish moneylender Shylock and names Antonio as the loan's guarantor. 
Shylock, who hates Antonio because of his Anti-Judaism and Antonio's customary refusal to borrow or lend money with interest, is at first reluctant, citing abuse he 
has suffered at Antonio's hand, but finally agrees to lend Antonio the sum without interest upon the condition that if Antonio is unable to repay it at the specified date, 
he may take a pound of Antonio's flesh. Bassanio does not want Antonio to accept such a risky condition. Antonio signs the contract.<p> At Venice, Antonio's ships are 
reported lost at sea. This leaves him unable to satisfy the bond. Shylock has Antonio brought to the court.

At Belmont, Bassanio receives a letter telling him that Antonio has been unable to return the loan taken from Shylock. Portia and Bassanio marry, as do Gratiano and Portia's handmaid Nerissa. Bassanio and Gratio 
leave for Venice with money from Portia to save Antonio's life. On their way, they seek the counsel of Portia's cousin, Bellario, a lawyer, at Padua.<p>
The climax of the play comes in the court of the Duke of Venice. Shylock refuses Bassanio's offer of 6,000 ducats, twice the amount of the loan. He demands his 
pound of flesh from Antonio. The Duke, wishing to save Antonio but unable to nullify a contract, refers the case to a visitor who introduces himself as Balthazar, a 
young male "doctor of the law", bearing a letter of recommendation to the Duke from the learned lawyer Bellario. The doctor is actually Portia in disguise, and the 
law clerk who accompanies her is actually Nerissa, also in disguise. As the court grants Shylock his bond and Antonio prepares for Shylock's knife, Portia points out that the contract only allows Shylock to remove the flesh, not the "blood", of 
Antonio. Thus, if Shylock were to shed any drop of Antonio's blood, his "lands and goods" would be forfeited under Venetian laws. Defeated, Shylock concedes to 
accepting Bassanio's offer of money for the defaulted bond, first his offer to pay "the bond thrice", which Portia rebuffs, telling him to take his bond, and then 
merely the principal, which Portia also prevents him from doing on the ground that he has already refused it. At Antonio's request, the Duke grants remission of the 
state's half of forfeiture. Bassanio does not recognise his disguised wife, but offers to give a present to the supposed lawyer. <p>
At Belmont, Portia and Nerissa taunt and pretend to accuse their husbands before revealing they were really the lawyer and his clerk in disguise. After all the other 
characters make amends, Antonio learns from Portia that three of his ships were not stranded and have returned safely after all.
