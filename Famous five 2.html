FIVE GO ADVENTURING AGAIN
</font></center></h1><br>
<h3>
Julian, Dick, Anne, George and Timmy return to Kirrin Cottage for the Christmas holidays. As a result of being off school due to illnesses, the four children have a 
tutor, Mr. Roland, during the holidays in order to catch up with the work they missed. One day during the holidays, the children visit Kirrin Farmhouse, and the 
owners allow George to show her cousins all around the farmhouse, and show them some of the old secret cubby- holes in the farmhouse.That night, George goes 
downstairs to see Timmy, as he was made to sleep outside because Mr. Roland didn't like dogs. George goes into Uncle Quentin's study to get the front door key, and 
finds Mr. Roland standing in the study. He tells George he heard a noise and came to investigate, but George finds it very suspicious. Finally in the end , the children 
recover the stolen papers that were robbed by Mr. Roland and his apprentices- the guests at Kirrin cottage. Everyone apologises to George for being angry at her, as 
in the end she was right. The book ends on a positive note, the criminals are caught and the children get to enjoy the rest of the holidays!
