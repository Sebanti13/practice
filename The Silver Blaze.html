Sherlock Holmes soon tracks down Silver Blaze (a racehorse), literally: his tracks (along with a man's) are clearly visible in the soil, A knife is found at the crime 
scene--a peculiarly delicate-looking one, with a small blade. Watson (holmes's friend), from his medical experience, identifies it as a cataract knife (used in 
cataract surgery). Useful as it is for that purpose, it would be unsuitable as a weapon; in addition, Straker also seems to have stabbed himself in the leg with it. 
But instead, Straker was killed when the horse, sensing that something was wrong, panicked and kicked the trainer in the head. The lame sheep had been used by 
Straker for practice.Colonel Ross's main concern, of course, is getting his horse back safely. Holmes chooses not to tell Ross where his horse has been (although he 
has known all along) until after the Wessex Cup, which is won by Silver Blaze. At first the Colonel does not recognize his own horse, since the animal's 
distinguishing white markings have been covered with dye. Holmes then explains the details of the case step-by-step to the satisfaction of the Colonel, Watson, and 
Inspector Gregory. What makes us interested is how Holmes uses his logic and observation skills to solve the case.
